# React Native AsyncStorage Intermittent Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in a React Native application.  The issue involves intermittent failures when retrieving data, where the function returns null or undefined despite successful previous storage.  This problem is difficult to reproduce consistently and may be related to asynchronous operations and race conditions.

## Problem Description

The core issue is that the `AsyncStorage.getItem` method sometimes returns null or undefined, even when the corresponding key exists with valid data. This inconsistency makes debugging and solving the problem challenging.  The provided `bug.js` file contains the problematic code snippet.  Solutions and debugging strategies are discussed in `bugSolution.js`.

## Solution

A solution is presented in the `bugSolution.js` file, which focuses on robust error handling and asynchronous operation management.  The solution includes additional checks and logging to help identify and mitigate the issue.
